            I love my job as web developer and I found myself very happy within Front-End after a year working in the area. I have 5 years now with html, css and javascript consuming rest apis, developed 10+ projects (web and mobile) and i can say that many things have changed (for the better) since internet explorer 6 support. I have a lot of ideas for web components and boilerplates, most of them are at my <a href="https://github.com/santospatrick" target="_blank">github</a>, <a href="https://codepen.io/Piricuca/" target="_blank">codepen</a> and <a href="https://codesandbox.io/u/santospatrick" target="_blank">codesandbox</a> profiles. I am constantly studying about web development in <a href="http://egghead.io" target="_blank">egghead.io</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/patrick-santos" target="_blank">udemy</a>. Also there are some values that I share and appreciate if my working environment has too:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Transparency</strong><span>, I love people that admit when they know and don’t know something, I think it helps a lot to identify the spot a team currently is so we can decide where to start and when to speed up or slow down</span></li>
            <li><strong>Diversity</strong>, distinct opinions and experiences make products better</li>
            <li><strong>Productivity</strong>, if you know me maybe you have seen how much extensions and plugins I have installed on my code editor and notebook. I am always looking for apps that makes me a better and faster developer. After some time working in a project you realize how much time you can save with keybindings, code snippets and boilerplates, i really love it</li>
            <li><strong>Communication</strong>, I like people that talks to me when something is wrong and also when something is right, I like to hear about new ideas, expectations and goals of a person or a group within a project, it makes life so much easier when everybody is aligned and knows where and how they want to achieve their goals</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong>, I am always improving my way of writing code and the way I treat people at work, I like companies that invest in community, courses and travelling so we can all grow together</li>
            </ul>
          <p>
            All the companies I worked until now were presencial and built on teams and I improved a lot both my personal and technical skills. At the agencies I learned a lot about javascript bundling (webpack, es6, code split, UMD pattern), css preprocessors (sass, stylus, css resets, theming), image compressing, minification of everything, a little bit of <i>SEO</i> and <i>Vue.js</i> that we used for <a href="https://www.pratafina.com.br/" target="_blank">a big e-commerce of jewelry at the time</a>. After getting some experience in production with these tools I have made my first cool project in github which was a <a href="https://github.com/santospatrick/ultimate-toolkit" target="_blank">boilerplate plug and play</a> to focus on developing code and not configuring these robotic processes, accelerating the creation of websites in general. At the software companies I learned about <i>SCRUM</i>, people and project management and I started to focus my studies in <i>Angular 1.x</i> and <i>React</i> consuming Rest Apis to build systems for a lot of users (not only websites for one client anymore).
          </p>
          <p>
            I also graduated in Graphic Design at 2017, as you can see I posted some work at <a href="https://www.behance.net/santospatrick" target="_blank">behance</a>, and when I see potential or value, I post something there.
          </p>
          <p>
            After some time I kind of got tired of front end development & design and tried backend with <i>Node.js</i> (as I already knew enough of javascript). I wasn’t too excited because my first language in back end was <i>PHP</i> and the developer experience I had wasn’t the best. But man, node made everything so easy: environment configuration, starting a new project and getting a rest api up and running within minutes, deploy and it basically has support to run everywhere (even in raspberry pi!).
          </p>
          <p>
            But as you can see, I came back (and really quickly actually) to front end and I decided that I would master it, not matter how much i had to study. So I started to learn about complex animations with CSS, javascript design patterns, good practices, some advanced things like internationalization (also applied in this project) and everything that makes a good software but keeping the code clean, coming back to refactor and improving performance of web apps.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I mentioned before, I worked on the mobile area too making 2 apps with <i>React Native</i> and I really like the technology, native experiences are kind of different from web responsive and I learned a lot designing screen flows and studying about Maps, GPS, camera and native features. Maybe it is not something I would work on weekdays, but temporary jobs are always welcome.
